## Project Description

Baskut Tuncak, the United Nation Special Rapporteur on the impacts of hazardous substances on human rights, needed a streamlined, sophisticated web presence specifically dedicated to his work under the UN mandate.

Work included a custom, responsive WordPress theme featuring:
1) Robust social media sharing options including email subscriptions, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn
2) Twitter integration in the form of a "Latest Tweets" feed
3) A news feed that intelligently culls the latest headlines for relevant results
4) Clear and concise presentation of numerous reports, press releases, statements, etc.
5) Posting to different portions of the site based on a robust tagging system

## Results

The site, as a way of amplifying Baskutâ€™s work, has received an outpouring of support on social media. The site came together quickly and features beautiful photography as well as a wealth of well-curated content.

## Process

The site was intended to be handed over to the client for regular content updates after development was complete. This is the primary rationale for choosing WordPress. There are several valid options
for Content Management Systems (all-in-one solutions that typically offer tools to build the site and, more importantly, an easy-to-use backend for updating and adding content) but WordPress is by far the most popular and arguably the best documented.

## Languages and Technologies

WordPress, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator
