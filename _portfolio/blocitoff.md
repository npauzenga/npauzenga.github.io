## Check it Out

The app is live on [Heroku](https://blocitoff-nate.herokuapp.com/)

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/npauzenga/Blocitoff)

## Explanation

Blocitoff was created as part of the [Bloc](http://bloc.io) curriculum. It was a very open-ended project with minimal instruction; guidance came in the form of [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) and regular code reviews with my instructor.

#### An example user story
>As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email

#### Additional plans

This particular project focuses on back-end techniques. The user stories and requirements prioritize functionality over beauty. For simplicity, the original app used very basic Bootstrap styling.

However, as this app serves as a nice test subject, I have been and will continue to update the front-end appearance and functionality. As of 2/2016 Bootstrap has been removed and I've started re-writing the views sans-framework. There are [issues](https://github.com/npauzenga/Blocitoff/issues) but new features and styling will come soon
