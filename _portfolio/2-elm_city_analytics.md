## Check it Out

The site is live at [elmcityanalytics.org](https://www.elmcityanalytics.org/). Please note that
this project is intended for campus organizations, not consumption by the general public. For this reason
access is limited to clients of Elm City Analytics.

## Project Description

Elm City Analytics is a startup that's built an app to help campus organizations
increase voter turnout in local and national elections. The original web app was built for a
mayoral campaign in 2013 and I was brought on in 2016 to update and refresh the app for a new buyer.

In addition to updating dependencies in a legacy codebase and resolving third-party API changes that had cropped up over the years, Elm City's client
had a list of updates and feature requests that needed to be included in the release. Among these
were several aesthetic changes to a registered voter's profile (and the app generally to reflect the client's campaign),
a significantly re-designed database schema, and additional sorting and reporting capabilities so the campaign
could quickly and easily target specific groups of voters for outreach.

## Results

Despite a few surprises we delivered an updated, fully-documented, and fully-functional app ahead of schedule. Elm City's client
was extremely pleased and will be using the app extensively in the upcoming election.



## Process, Technologies & Techniques

The app was written in Ruby on Rails and, as an extremely data-driven app, Backbone.js was used for the majority of the front-end logic. Third-party API integrations
include Facebook and Twilio for voter outreach.
