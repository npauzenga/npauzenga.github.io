<p style="text-align: center;">“I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.”
― Stanley Kubrick</p>

An excellent, exciting, well-produced introduction to programming and computer science. Programming concepts are introduced using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT's Scratch</a> visual programming language before being translated into the C programming language. There are several videos per week, detailed problem sets, and an active community to help you along the way.

This courses uses a book called <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/" target="_blank">How to Design Programs</a>, which is what attracted me. One of the authors, Matthias Felleisen, taught a friend at Northeastern University who subsequently recommended the book to me. I worked through the first few chapters and, though the text is great, the concepts can be a little nebulous without the supporting lectures. The course provides a very structured and well-supported path through the material. The material itself is extremely rewarding. I found the H2DP/H2DD approach to be pretty revolutionary.

I found this one on my own through <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT's Open Courseware</a> before discovering a "live" version on <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">Edx</a>. It's a challenging course, teaching programming concepts to students with a solid mathematical background (we'll refer to them as "MIT Students"). The problem sets require a bit more domain knowledge than some of the other courses and can be a little more challenging right off the bat.
