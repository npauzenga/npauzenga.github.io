“I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.”

## Completed Courses

### [Bloc - Rails Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp)
Bloc is a coding _bootcamp_\* focusing on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, Boostrap, HTML5, and CSS3. It is split into two sections -- back-end and front-end. I've completed the Rails back-end portion and am currently working on the front-end.

\*Bloc is a little different than a typical bootcamp. The program is significantly longer (9 months as opposed to 3-4) and is a 1-on-1 apprenticeship rather than a class setting. While I think there are certainly merits to both approaches, Bloc turned out to be an excellent fit for my learning style.

That said, I don't think it's for everyone. A more detailed overview to come.

### [Harvard Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

An excellent, exciting, well-produced introduction to programming and computer science. Programming concepts are introduced using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT's Scratch</a> visual programming language before being translated into the C programming language. There are several videos per week, detailed problem sets, and an active community to help you along the way.

### [UBCx Systematic Program Design](https://www.edx.org/course/systematic-program-design-part-1-core-ubcx-spd1x)

This courses uses a book called <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/" target="_blank">How to Design Programs</a>, which is what attracted me. One of the authors, Matthias Felleisen, taught a friend at Northeastern University who subsequently recommended the book to me. I worked through the first few chapters and, though the text is great, the concepts can be a little nebulous without the supporting lectures. The course provides a very structured and well-supported path through the material. The material itself is extremely rewarding. I found the H2DP/H2DD approach to be pretty revolutionary.

### [MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0)

I found this one on my own through <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT's Open Courseware</a> before discovering a "live" version on <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">Edx</a>. It's a challenging course, teaching programming concepts to students with a solid mathematical background (we'll refer to them as "MIT Students"). The problem sets require a bit more domain knowledge than some of the other courses and can be a little more challenging right off the bat.

### [Treehouse Rails Development Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/rails-development)

Treehouse is an excellent resource. Their production value is outstanding, the materials are well organized, and a lot of though has clearly gone into the lesson plans.

I still use Treehouse very regularly. The topics available are not very advanced (they specialize in thorough introductions to various languages and concepts) but there is simply no better resource for getting started in a new web-related technology.

### [Codecademy Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

Codecademy is an excellent place to get a "feel" for a new language or framework. The exercises are well-written and seem to get better every day.

It's not the place to go for an in-depth look at any of the technologies they support and a user should not expect to come away with the skills necessary to contribute to a project with what they've learned.

### 	[Microsoft Academy - C# Fundamentals](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295?l=bifAqFYy_204984382)

Bob Tabor is a great instructor. In this course he goes over object-oriented programming fundamentals in the context of C# web apps.
